YOUR TASK IS TO ANALYZE ANY PROVIDED TEXT AND CLASSIFY IT INTO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING SENTIMENT CATEGORIES:\n\n{categories}\n\n###INSTRUCTIONS###\n\n- YOU MUST CATEGORIZE THE SENTIMENT **BASED ON THE ENTIRE CONTEXT**, NOT JUST SURFACE-LEVEL CUES\n- YOU MUST DETECT AND CONSIDER SIGNS OF FRUSTRATION, UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS, OR EXCESSIVE BACK-AND-FORTH INTERACTIONS\n- IF THE TEXT INVOLVES **MULTIPLE INTERACTIONS WITH NO CLEAR RESOLUTION TO A PROBLEM**, YOU MUST CLASSIFY THE SENTIMENT AS **NEGATIVE**, EVEN IF THE LANGUAGE IS POLITE OR NEUTRAL\n- ALWAYS FOLLOW THE CHAIN OF THOUGHT TO PRODUCE A WELL-REASONED SENTIMENT DECISION\n\n###CHAIN OF THOUGHT###\n\n1. UNDERSTAND:\n   1.1 READ THE ENTIRE TEXT INPUT CAREFULLY\n   1.2 IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY SUBJECT, CONTEXT, AND ANY EMOTIONAL SIGNALS PRESENT\n\n2. BASICS:\n   2.1 DETECT KEYWORDS, TONE, AND EXPRESSIONS THAT SIGNAL EMOTION (E.G., \"FRUSTRATED\", \"THANK YOU\", \"STILL WAITING\", \"NOT WORKING\")\n\n3. BREAK DOWN:\n   3.1 IF MULTIPLE MESSAGES ARE PRESENT, SEGMENT THEM AND DETERMINE THE FLOW OF INTERACTION\n   3.2 DETECT WHETHER A PROBLEM IS STATED, ADDRESSED, AND RESOLVED\n\n4. ANALYZE:\n   4.1 EVALUATE THE PRESENCE OF GRATITUDE, ANGER, CONFUSION, OR APPRECIATION\n   4.2 IF THERE IS **ONGOING INTERACTION WITHOUT RESOLUTION**, CLASSIFY AS NEGATIVE\n\n5. BUILD:\n   5.1 USE EVIDENCE FROM THE TEXT TO JUSTIFY SENTIMENT LABEL\n   5.2 CONSIDER USER INTENTION AND EMOTIONAL TONE\n\n6. EDGE CASES:\n   6.1 IF THE USER SEEMS NEUTRAL BUT THERE IS AN UNRESOLVED ISSUE, LEAN TOWARD NEGATIVE\n   6.2 IF A COMPLAINT ENDS IN SATISFACTION OR GRATITUDE, CONSIDER IT NEUTRAL OR POSITIVE BASED ON CONTEXT\n\n7. FINAL ANSWER:\n   7.1 OUTPUT THE CHOSEN CATEGORY FROM {categories}\n   7.2 PROVIDE A SHORT EXPLANATION JUSTIFYING YOUR DECISION BASED ON THE ANALYSIS ABOVE\n\n###WHAT NOT TO DO###\n\n- DO NOT IGNORE CONTEXTUAL CLUES SUCH AS LENGTHY CONVERSATIONS WITHOUT OUTCOMES\n- DO NOT ASSUME POLITE LANGUAGE MEANS POSITIVE SENTIMENT IF PROBLEMS REMAIN UNRESOLVED\n- NEVER CLASSIFY AS NEUTRAL WHEN THE USER IS EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION OR UNCERTAINTY DUE TO LACK OF HELP\n- AVOID ONE-LINE RESPONSES WITHOUT CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS\n- NEVER SKIP THE JUSTIFICATION STEP\n\n###FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES###\n\n**Input:**  \n_\"Hi, I contacted support three times already and still no one has fixed the issue. I’m very disappointed.\"_\n\n**Output:**  \nCategory: **Negative**  \nJustification: The user expresses repeated attempts to solve a problem without resolution and uses negative emotional language (\"disappointed\").\n\n---\n\n**Input:**  \n_\"Thank you for finally resolving the issue. It took a while but I’m glad it’s working now.\"_  \n\n**Output:**  \nCategory: **Positive**  \nJustification: Despite delay, the problem was resolved and the final sentiment is satisfaction and appreciation.\n\n---\n\n**Input:**  \n_\"Hello, just checking in on the status. It’s been a few days and I haven’t heard anything.\"_  \n\n**Output:**  \nCategory: **Negative**  \nJustification: The message implies unresolved issue and prolonged silence, triggering negative sentiment even if polite.\n"}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.sentimentAnalysis","typeVersion":1,"position":[-40,0],"id":"f728a9c4-f406-4962-9f1b-0efb0ca10ae7","name":"Sentiment Analysis"},{"parameters":{"model":{"__rl":true,"value":"llama-3.3-70B-Instruct","mode":"list","cachedResultName":"llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"},"options":{}},"type":"@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatOpenAi","typeVersion":1.2,"position":[-140,200],"id":"86e787ad-4e34-479e-96b5-3fd61d80da0b","name":"OpenAI Chat Model","credentials":{"openAiApi":{"id":"3ksygUY2AafRzzfk","name":"Proxy LiteLLM"}}},{"parameters":{"respondWith":"json","responseBody":"={{ $json.sentimentAnalysis }}","options":{}},"type":"n8n-nodes-base.respondToWebhook","typeVersion":1.2,"position":[340,0],"id":"09a1e415-ad6a-4831-acd1-65668774f309","name":"Respond to Webhook"}],"connections":{"Webhook":{"main":[[{"node":"Sentiment Analysis","type":"main","index":0}]]},"OpenAI Chat Model":{"ai_languageModel":[[{"node":"Sentiment Analysis","type":"ai_languageModel","index":0}]]},"Sentiment Analysis":{"main":[[{"node":"Respond to Webhook","type":"main","index":0}],[{"node":"Respond to Webhook","type":"main","index":0}],[{"node":"Respond to Webhook","type":"main","index":0}]]}},"settings":{"executionOrder":"v1","timezone":"America/Bogota","callerPolicy":"workflowsFromSameOwner","errorWorkflow":"Txht1wrdLAI370JY","timeSavedPerExecution":5},"staticData":null,"meta":{"templateCredsSetupCompleted":true},"pinData":{},"versionId":"91718c90-ac68-4da8-acee-16f2555b1ff8","triggerCount":1,"tags":[]}
